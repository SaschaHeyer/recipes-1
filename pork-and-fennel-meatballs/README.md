**Serves 3–4**

This is a really, _really_ simple dish that tastes absolutely unreal,
particularly if you—like me—love fennel. You can also, optionally, add a bit of
a kick by adding some chili to the sauce. I serve mine over cubed, boiled,
paprika potatoes.

## Ingredients

* 6 good quality pork sausages
* Fennel seeds
* 1 x onion, chopped
* 2 x tin chopped tomatoes
* Chili flakes (optional)
* 2 x potatoes, peeled and cubed
* Salt and pepper
* Paprika

## Method

1.  Empty the six sausages’ contents into a bowl and discard skins. Pour in an
    arbitrary amount of fennel seeds, according to how much you like the taste.
2.  Mix the sausage meat and fennel seeds together and form into 18 little
    meatballs (one sausage makes three meatballs).
3.  Sweat onions in a little bit of oil in a heavy bottomed pan.
4.  Once these are softened, add meatballs and lightly brown them.
5.  Once browned, add both tins of tomatoes and cook for as long as you can
    (over half an hour, ideally).
6.  Add chili powder or flakes if desired. Fennel and chili flavours might be
    wrong ‘on paper’, but I love it!
7.  Boil a pan of water and add the potatoes. Boil for 15 minutes.
8.  Once boiled, drain potatoes and add back into the empty pan. Coat lightly in
    oil, sprinkle with paprika and salt and pepper. Beat about a little soften
    and fluffy the edges.
9.  Place potatoes on a warmed plate and pour the meatballs over the top.
10. Enjoy!
