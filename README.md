# Recipes

Living alone, and enjoying food, I spend a lot of my time cooking. I don’t eat
takeaways or ready meals so over the past four years or so, cooking has become
something of a hobby of mine.

I do not claim to be an expert, or a chef, or skilled or even knowledgable, but
here are a few of the things I like to cook most.

I accept no responsibility for you finding things disgusting, or for butchering
your national dish.

Please suggest improvements or variations, I’m always open to new things!
